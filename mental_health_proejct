==The Effects of Social Media on Mental Health

/* 
With the rise of social media, there has been a lot of discussion on the effects is can have on the mental 
health of individuals. Although wider and more long-term studies are still to come, it is interesting to analyse
the data currently availible.

In this project I will take the following dataset to analyse trends in time on social media and the effects it 
can have on individuals within the scope of these 4 questions:

* Which social media platforms are the most commonly used among the survey participants?
* Does the time spent on social media have a significant impact on the likelihood of experiencing symptoms associated
with mental disorders, specifically ADHD, anxiety, self-esteem issues, and depression??
* Does age have any correlation in time spent online?
* What is the most common time online for each relationship group?

Information on the dataset
​
This particular dataset comes from a research project for a statistics course at the University of Liberal Arts 
Bangladesh which surveyed 481 of individuals in a project aiming at investigating correlation between the amount
of time spent on social and mental health. It must be noted that data this small is not a true reflection of a 
population, and so it would be interesting to see a larger scale version of this dataset in the future.

--Scope of the dataset
/* 
The first coloumns of the dataset are the following variables:
* Age
* gender
* relationship status
* occupational status
* affiliated organisations
* social media used
* time spent on social media in hours.

The second part of the survey used a likert scale with the following questions, each one being tied for a potential mental disorder:

* How often do you find yourself using Social media without a specific purpose? 
* How often do you get distracted by Social media when you are busy doing something?
* Do you feel restless if you haven't used Social media in a while?
* How easily distracted are you?
* How much are you bothered by worries?
* Do you find it difficult to concentrate on things?
* How often do you compare yourself to other successful people through the use of social media?
* Following the previous question, how do you feel about these comparisons, generally speaking?
* How often do you feel depressed or down?
* How frequently does your interest in daily activities fluctuate?
* How often do you face issues regarding sleep?

--Data Cleaning

/*
Althoughh this dataset is pretty clean, there are a few changes needed:

* Simplify the column names to be easier to read and use.
* Only add in relevant columns to a temporary table.
* Cast age as an integer
* Standardise the gender responses as there are four versions of non-binary within the data.
- In the following CTE, I also decided to separate the float response of the question "Which platforms do you use"
in order to ease my visualisation step. Instead, I will add new columns with each social media otpion and a boolean response.

Question 2: 
Which social media platforms are the most commonly used among the survey participants?

For the following question, I'm interested in getting a percentage of users in the survey 
on each platform:

Answer:

tiktok_percentage= 19.54%

facebook_percentage= 84.62%

twitter_percentage= 27.3%

pintrest_percentage= 30.15%

snapchat_percentage= 37.63%

discord_percentage= 41.16%

instagram_percentage= 74.64%

youtube_percentage= 85.65%

The most used platform amongst survey participants was YouTube, with 85.65% addmitting to using the platofrm.
This was shortly following by Facebook at 84.62%.

This data was taken before the rise of TikTok during the Covid Pandemic. It would be interesting to have 
surveyed the same indiviudals in 2024 to see the change in platforms that individuals use.

  Question 3: Does the time spent on social media have a significant impact on the likelihood
  of experiencing symptoms associated with mental disorders, specifically ADHD, anxiety, 
  self-esteem issues, and depression??

For the following question, my current data will need some temporary rejigging. The students 
who created the survey categorised the questions into one of the following Mental Health Disorders:
* ADHD (purposeless_scrolling, often_distracted, how_distracted, difficulty_concentrating)
* Anxiety (restless,worried)
* Depression (often_depressed, daily_interest,sleep_problems)
* Low Self Esteem (compare, seek_validation)

I will have to group the question responses into these sections and calculate the mean value for each participant.

Answer:

very single negative mental health average score got higher when the time online increases, suggesting that more time online does lead to a higher chance of poor mental health amoung these participants.

Question 4:  What is the most common time online for each relationship group?

Answer:
Row	      Relationship	            Most_Common_Time_Online
1       	Married	                  Between 1 and 2 hours

3        	Single	                  More than 5 hours
4	        In a relationship	        More than 5 hours


The groups that spent the most time online were those in a relationship and those who were single,
with the most common reponse being More than 5 hours.
The divorced groups spent the least amount of time online with less than one hour.

Perhaps those in a relationship should spent more time offlilne with their partners :)

--Conclusion

/*
Correlation between Age and Time Spent Online: The correlation coefficient between age and time spent online is 0.361.
This value indicates a weak positive correlation. Contrary to popular belief or stereotypes, this suggests that the age of
the participant does not strongly correlate with the amount of time spent online. Therefore, claims blaming younger generations,
such as Gen Z, for excessive internet usage may not be entirely accurate or applicable to this dataset.

Platform Usage Among Survey Participants: According to the survey data, YouTube was the most commonly used platform among 
participants, with 85.65% admitting to using it. Following closely behind is Facebook, with 84.62% of participants acknowledging
its usage. Notably, this data was collected before the widespread popularity of TikTok during the Covid-19 pandemic. Considering
the rapid shifts in social media trends, it would be intriguing to re-survey the same individuals in 2024 to observe any changes
in platform preferences over time.

Relationship Between Time Online and Mental Health: An interesting trend emerges when analyzing the relationship between time 
spent online and participants' mental health. As the time spent online increases, every negative mental health average score also
increases. This suggests a potential correlation between prolonged internet usage and poorer mental health among participants.
However, since this data is on such a small scale, we cannot conclude this to be the truth for the whole population.

Relationship Status and Time Online: The groups that spent the most time online were those in a relationship and those who 
were single, with the most common reponse being More than 5 hours. The divorced groups spent the least amount of time online
with less than one hour.
